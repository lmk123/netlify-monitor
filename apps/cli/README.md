# netlify-usage-cli

A cli program to print out the usage of netlify.

1. Installing with npm: `npm i -g @lmk123/netlify-useage-cli`
2. Create a Netlify token: [https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens)

Then:

```zsh
$ export NETLIFY_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>
$ nuc
```

If all is well, the console will output the following:

```text
